# Contributing Guide

If you're contributing to this repository please follow these rules, otherwise you're welcome to fork me :)

- Add a `CHANGELOG` entry describing what you did (summary of your commit(s)).
- Add your email to this file under _Authors_ if it hasn't been added already.

That's it. If you're wondering what to put down for the version in the `CHANGELOG` we can
hash that out in the pull/merge request.
